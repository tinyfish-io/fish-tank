# AgentQL examples and tutorials

## Get started with AgentQL

You will need your [API Key](https://dev.agentql.com/) and the [AgentQL SDK](https://docs.agentql.com/installation/sdk-installation). You can get set up in less than five minutes with the [AgentQL Quick Start](https://docs.agentql.com/quick-start).

## Virtual Environment

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for dependency and virtual environment management.
You don't have to use Poetry to run the examples, but it will make it easier to manage dependencies and isolate the project environment.
If you choose to use Poetry follow these simple steps to get everything setup:

- **Install Poetry**. Follow [Poetry official guidelines here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer)
- **Install dependencies**. Run `poetry install` in the project root directory
- **Activate the virtual environment**. Run `poetry shell` to activate the virtual environment

## Examples

This list contains basic use case examples that demonstrate the fundamental functionalities of AgentQL. Itâ€™s a great starting point for those new to AgentQL or looking to understand its core capabilities.
